=== Manage Your Posts Only ===
Contributors: mincus
Tags: admin, users, posts
Requires at least: 2.5
Tested up to: 2.5.1

Makes it so normal users can see only their posts and drafts from the manage posts screen.  Great for multi-user blogs where you want users to only see posts that they have created.  Wordpress already makes it so they cannot edit the posts, but still allows them to see the titles.  This can get annoying to find your posts mixed in with thousands of others.

== Installation ==
1. Upload 'manage_your_posts_only.php' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Log in as a non-admin user to ensure that they can only see posts listed in the managed tab that they have created
